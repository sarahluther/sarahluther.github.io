				<h1>The Age of Flowers</h1>
				<p>The Age of Flowers a journey through a relationship of a deep lover. Those that are deep lovers understand that the heart is only the start of love, but it actually encompasses the whole being. If you could look back and change the outcome, would you?

				<p>Elaine had always reserved her heart, but this tall figure had crossed her path and somehow seemed to draw out her heart. Erik saw her in ways that no one else understood her. It was almost that he was even unaware of how much he saw of her, or he never let on to what he felt. Join Elaine as she journeys through what it means to love beyond the boarders of her heart.

				<p>Love deeply, purely and wholly.</p>
				<p>There is only one life that you are given. Love may come and go, but it is worth giving your whole heart, even if people don't understand it yet? Yes! It is okay to be a lush for life and love. For those with deep and vulnerable heart, it is okay to love and reincarnate past love into new chapters of your life.</p>

				<div class="quote">
				<p>"People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life.</p>

				<p>A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave.</p>

				<p>A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..."</p>

				<h1>About The Author</h1>

				<p>I enjoy tinkering with stuff, along with being a slight techie and messing with photography when I ever get the chance. I am a lover of life and pursuer of inner healing. There are too many fun things to do in life. I decided not to pick just one avenue, I want to experience life in every way possible.</p>

				<p>In life, I have been found to be a lush for love. I have given love whole-heartedly and without reservation, making the conscious decision to not control or manipulate the people, especially in relationships. To the best of my ability and what I knew at the time, I set out to love open handed. Relationships start with beautiful people, and have good intentions. As humans, we get caught up in wanting to be right and not what is best. I got so focused in wanting to make it work, to the point that I was willing to make sacrifices to love and support the beautiful human that was in my hand to love. From this, I have found inspiration to write and share my passion. I have learned through life and hope that my story can give courage love life in a whole new way.</p>

			<h2>A gift of heart</h2>

			<p>Sifted by the sands of time,
			There is no chest to lay my head on..
			No Love to find me.</p> 

			<p>All love has been is one sided.
			Only words that glisten in the sun.
			I have no hope of yet a true found love.</p>

			<p>Your heart is deep and your love is vast,
			You do not know how to share it yet.
			I have called to your heart.
			When will you answer my call, kind sir?</p>

			<p>Tears ran down his cheek, 
			His voice trembling, 
			"I did not mean to be a jerk"
			Love shown through the tears.</p> 

			<p>Her heart, she gave him months ago. â€¨
			Not a word was whispered of such love till questioned.</p> 
			<p>The package came on a Thursday. 
			As he set it down, he realized what it was. 
			He opened it, and read of undying love. 
			"This is how I fell in love with you"</p>

			<p>Every page was her heart engrave with such joy. 
			She broke down every wall with her words.
			The tears flowed like rivers rage. 
			What everyone dare desire, he held in his hands.
			Her untainted heart lie in his arms.</p>

			<p>Tears flowed as his heart gave way. 
			He could not understand such an free gift of love.</p>

			<br>

			<p>She lay there, with tears in her eyes.
			"Its the end... Its over."
			These words sank deep in her spirit.
			Months had gone without word from him. 
			He chose neglect to aid in the heart ache.
			Left alone, she had no choice. 
			All her love lay in this book of her love story.
			All that was left was pain.</p> 

			<p>"To rip life from my heart, all is lost."
			On those pages where her life.
			Instead of burying it, she sent it to her love.
			If hope is dead, then he will at least know of the love she had.</p>
