<p>In life, I have been found to be a lush for love. I have given love whole-heartedly and without reservation, making the conscious decision to not control or manipulate the other person, especially in relationships. To the best of my ability and what I knew at the time, I set out to love open handed. Relationship start with beautiful people, and have good intentions. As humans, we get caught up in wanting to be right and not what is best. I got so focused in wanting to make it work, to the point that I was willing to make sacrifices to love and support the beautiful human that was in my hand to love.</p>

<p id="tie">It is easy to love and easier to fall in love, yet it takes courage to let love go, knowing that it was the best that you have had thus far.</p>
